# Tz Global Event Timer

This project was created to help manage events in multiple timezones. I play games with people around the world and co-ordinating when things will start is always difficult.  I created this project to make this process easier.

## Usage

Load the page into a web browser. Select a date/time for the event in your LOCAL time. Optionally, you can add a short description, then click the Create Event Link. It will generate a URL. You can click on it directly, manually copy the link, or click the copy to clipboard button. Distribute that link to friends, when they view it they will see the even shown in their local time zone with a count down to the event.
